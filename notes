Coding in C++ or Java, OpenGL

Interaction of object with environment--cells that detect scene (big) and objects (small) in the same area of the brain

High-energy vs low energy states: table balanced on leg vs table resting on all 4

--me: how do I model "high energy states" within the scene

--hypothesis: some neural reaction to high energy States vs low energy States (question: where do we expect to see the neural reaction? Automate process of finding neurons reacting to the pose?"

Start as cube, not sphere, to ensure it has stable positions. Then add projections. Potentially use PCA to find axis along projections, to determine high energy orientation?
Why abstract art cube resting on corner is considered more evocative than cube in stable position
